# visualquantumtunneling
This project consists on a simple python program which its main objective relies on providing a clear visualization of what occurs when a wave packet collides against a potential barrier, or better saying, it's a visual device for quantum tunneling.

Although the problem solved here is a one-dimensional and linear one, the numerical method used for solving it is the Split-Step Fourier Method. Also known as BPM (beam propagation method) on the context of optics, it's usually finds it service on solving nonlinear partial differential equations.

An one-dimensional Schr√∂dinger equation will represent the wave packet given its quantum behaviour.
